- Tree-based allgather
    - Useful for MVAPICH as well
    - PMI to discover parent and children and use UD QPs
    - Use shared-memory segments to store table of UD addresses, to gather once per node

- PMI implementation needs to be made general - Jan 12

- Efficient use of PMI on the MPI side

- Large scale runs on systems
    - Adam has run till 400 nodes, need larger
    - Hari will run large-scale runs on stampede
    - Lets try to have this by Jan 7th
    - Caching effects, first run taking longer than other runs within the allocation
        - Some sort of OS caching
        - RSH used in LLNL (an in-house munge version) that execs shell which runs the command
        - Should try to replicate this behavior on a non-LLNL machine
        - Using SSH to avoid this caching
        - Using Bash or any of the *sh shells
        - Hari/Jonathan will try on stampede
    - IB/TCP experiments
    - PMI numbers
