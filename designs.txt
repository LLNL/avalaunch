1) launch spawn tree
  a) strmap compression vs none
  b) thread parallelism on fork/exec and/or accept loop vs single thread
  c) spawn_net TCP sockets vs multiplex rsh/ssh sockets vs UD
  d) tree structure k-ary vs k-nomial, best value of k
  e) bcast vs scatter vs IP or IB multicast
  f) network topology

2) start application process group
  a) bcast exe vs not and pt2pt vs IP or IB multicast
  b) bcast vs scatter of app params

3) connect app processes
  a) PMI implementation: allgather to each spawn node vs distributed key/value store
  b) PMI networking: sockets vs UD
  c) MPI optimization: create single UD addr table per node in shmem vs table per process
  d) allgather UD addr using UD starting from ring read from PMI
  e) ring collective: 2 messages per node vs p (for p processes on a node)
